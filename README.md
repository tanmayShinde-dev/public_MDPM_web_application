🧠 Multiple Disease Prediction System

An AI-powered web application that predicts the likelihood of multiple diseases based on health parameters. By combining trained machine learning models with a user-focused interface, the project delivers health insights in real time, making early detection more accessible.

This project was originally built as a hackathon solution, where the challenge was to design a healthcare-focused system that demonstrates both technical innovation and real-world impact.

🔍 Overview

The system provides predictions for:
❤️ Heart Disease
🍬 Diabetes
🩺 Hypertension
🧩 Parkinson’s Disease

Users simply input their health data, and the app processes it through multiple ML models to generate risk predictions with confidence scores. Results are presented instantly through an intuitive interface designed for clarity and ease of use.

⚡ Tech Highlights

Python for development and data handling

Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy for ML workflows

Streamlit for delivering an interactive and responsive UI

Modular, extensible design for scalability and future disease models

🎯 Key Features

Multi-disease prediction on a single platform

Prioritizes UI/UX for seamless user interaction

Lightweight, efficient, and easy to deploy

Transparent and reliable machine learning integration

💡 Developed during a hackathon, this project demonstrates how applied machine learning and modern web delivery can converge to provide practical healthcare insights. Beyond competition, it stands as an example of how AI can address meaningful problems in accessible ways.
